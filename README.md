# ExpressMapper.Core 

ExpressMapper.Core is a fork of Expressmapper built against netstandard2.0, net461, and net471. No or next to no core code changes were made at this point (6/2019) from the original project, which itself has been quiet since 2017, and was in desparate need of an update. The "NETCORE" project version was an old xproj thing, etc.
